                <h5 class="description">The Mid-Autumn Festival (Chinese: 中秋節 / 中秋节), also known as the Moon Festival or Mooncake Festival,
                    is a traditional festival celebrated in Chinese culture. Similar holidays are celebrated in Japan (Tsukimi),
                    Korea (Chuseok), Vietnam (Tết Trung Thu), and other countries in East and Southeast Asia.

                    It is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture; its popularity is on par with that of Chinese New Year.
                    The history of the Mid-Autumn Festival dates back over 3,000 years.<br> <br>The festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar with a full moon at night,
                    corresponding to mid-September to early October of the Gregorian calendar.<br><br> On this day, the Chinese believe that
                    the Moon is at its brightest and fullest size, coinciding with harvest time in the middle of Autumn.<br><br>

                    Lanterns of all size and shapes, are carried and displayed – symbolic beacons that light people's path to prosperity
                    and good fortune. Mooncakes, a rich pastry typically filled with sweet-bean, egg yolk, meat or lotus-seed paste,
                    are traditionally eaten during this festival.<br><br> The Mid-Autumn Festival is based on the legend of Chang'e,
                    the Moon goddess in Chinese mythology.</h5>

                <h5 class="description">
                    The festival celebrates three fundamental concepts that are closely connected:

                    Gathering, such as family and friends coming together, or harvesting crops for the festival. <br><br>
                    It is said the Moon is the brightest and roundest on this day which means family reunion. Consequently,
                    this is the main reason why the festival is thought to be important.<br><br>
                    Thanksgiving, to give thanks for the harvest, or for harmonious unions
                    Praying (asking for conceptual or material satisfaction), such as for babies, a spouse, beauty,
                    longevity, or for a good future
                    Traditions and myths surrounding the festival are formed around these concepts, although traditions
                    have changed over time due to changes in technology, science, economy, culture, and religion.
                    It's about well being together.

                <h5 class="description">
                    The Chinese have celebrated the harvest during the autumn full moon since the Shang dynasty
                    (c. 1600–1046 BCE). The term mid-autumn (中秋) first appeared in Rites of Zhou, a written collection
                    of rituals of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BCE). As for the royal court, it was dedicated to the
                    goddess Taiyinxingjun (太陰星君; Tàiyīn xīng jūn). This is still true for Taoism and Chinese folk religion.<br><br>

                    The celebration as a festival only started to gain popularity during the early Tang dynasty (618–907 CE).
                    One legend explains that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang started to hold formal celebrations in his palace after having
                    explored the Moon-Palace.<br><br>

                    In the Northern Song Dynasty, the Mid Autumn Festival has become a popular folk festival, and officially
                    designated the 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar as the Mid Autumn Festival.<br><br>

                    By the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the mid autumn festival had become one of the main folk festivals in China.
                    The Empress Dowager Cixi (late 19th century) enjoyed celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival so much that she would
                    spend the period between the thirteenth and seventeenth day of the eighth month staging elaborate rituals.

                <h4 style="font-weight: bold" class="title">Moon worship</h4>
                <h5 class="description">
                    An important part of the festival celebration is Moon worship. The ancient Chinese believed in rejuvenation
                    being associated with the Moon and water, and connected this concept to the menstruation of women,
                    calling it "monthly water". The Zhuang people, for example, have an ancient fable saying the Sun
                    and Moon are a couple and the stars are their children, and when the Moon is pregnant, it becomes round,
                    and then becomes crescent after giving birth to a child. These beliefs made it popular among women to worship
                    and give offerings to the Moon on this evening.In some areas of China, there are still customs in which
                    "men do not worship the moon and the women do not offer sacrifices to the kitchen gods."<br><br>

                    In China, the Mid-Autumn festival symbolizes the family reunion and on this day, all families
                    will appreciate the Moon in the evening, because it is the 15th day of the eighth month of the
                    Chinese lunisolar calendar, when the moon is at its fullest. There is a beautiful myth about the
                    Mid-Autumn festival, that is Chang'e flying to the Moon.<br><br>

                    Offerings are also made to a more well-known lunar deity, Chang'e, known as the Moon Goddess
                    of Immortality. The myths associated with Chang'e explain the origin of Moon worship during this day.
                    One version of the story is as follows, as described in Lihui Yang's Handbook of Chinese Mythology:

                    In the ancient past, there was a hero named Hou Yi who was excellent at archery. His wife was
                    Chang'e. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky together, causing great disaster to the people.
                    Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent
                    him the elixir of immortality. Yi did not want to leave Chang'e and be immortal without her,
                    so he let Chang'e keep the elixir. However, Peng Meng, one of his apprentices, knew this secret.
                    So, on the fifteenth of August in the Chinese lunisolar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Peng Meng
                    broke into Yi's house and forced Chang'e to give the elixir to him. Chang'e refused to do so. Instead,
                    she swallowed it and flew into the sky. Since she loved her husband and hoped to live nearby, she chose
                    the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened, he felt so sad that he displayed
                    the fruits and cakes Chang'e liked in the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about
                    these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang'e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.<br><br>

                    “when people learned of this story, they burnt incense on a long altar and prayed to Chang'e,
                    now the goddess of the Moon, for luck and safety. The custom of praying to the Moon on Mid-Autumn
                    Day has been handed down for thousands of years since that time."<br><br>

                    Handbook of Chinese Mythology also describes an alternate common version of the myth:

                    After the hero Houyi shot down nine of the ten suns, he was pronounced king by the thankful people.
                    However, he soon became a conceited and tyrannical ruler. In order to live long without death, he asked
                    for the elixir from Xiwangmu. But his wife, Chang'e, stole it on the fifteenth of August because she did
                    not want the cruel king to live long and hurt more people. She took the magic potion to prevent her husband
                    from becoming immortal. Houyi was so angry when discovered that Chang'e took the elixir, he shot at his wife
                    as she flew toward the moon, though he missed. Chang'e fled to the moon and became the spirit of the moon.
                    Houyi died soon because he was overcome with great anger. Thereafter, people offer a sacrifice to Chang'e
                    on every fifteenth day of eighth month to commemorate Chang'e's action.

                <h5 class="description">
                    Making and sharing mooncakes is one of the hallmark traditions of this festival. In Chinese culture,
                    a round shape symbolizes completeness and reunion. Thus, the sharing and eating of round mooncakes
                    among family members during the week of the festival signifies the completeness and unity of families.
                    [22] In some areas of China, there is a tradition of making mooncakes during the night of the Mid-Autumn
                    Festival. The senior person in that household would cut the mooncakes into pieces and distribute them
                    to each family member, signifying family reunion. In modern times, however, making mooncakes at home
                    has given way to the more popular custom of giving mooncakes to family members, although the meaning of
                    maintaining familial unity remains.<br><br>

                    Although typical mooncakes can be around a few centimetres in diameter, imperial chefs have made
                    some as large as 8 meters in diameter, with its surface pressed with designs of Chang'e, cassia trees,
                    or the Moon-Palace. One tradition is to pile 13 mooncakes on top of each other to mimic a pagoda,
                    the number 13 being chosen to represent the 13 months in a full Chinese lunisolar year. The spectacle
                    of making very large mooncakes continues in modern China.<br><br>

                    According to Chinese folklore, a Turpan businessman offered cakes to Emperor Taizong of Tang
                    in his victory against the Xiongnu on the fifteenth day of the eighth Chinese lunisolar month.
                    Taizong took the round cakes and pointed to the moon with a smile, saying, "I'd like to invite
                    the toad to enjoy the hú (胡) cake." After sharing the cakes with his ministers, the custom of
                    eating these hú cakes spread throughout the country. Eventually these became known as mooncakes.
                    Although the legend explains the beginnings of mooncake-giving, its popularity and ties to the festival
                    began during the Song dynasty (906–1279 CE).<br><br>

                    Another popular legend concerns the Han Chinese's uprising against the ruling Mongols at the end
                    of the Yuan dynasty (1280–1368 CE), in which the Han Chinese used traditional mooncakes to conceal
                    the message that they were to rebel on Mid-Autumn Day. Because of strict controls upon Han Chinese
                    families imposed by the Mongols in which only 1 out of every 10 households was allowed to own a
                    knife guarded by a Mongolian, this coordinated message was important to gather as many available weapons as possible.

                    Imperial dishes served on this occasion included nine-jointed lotus roots which symbolize peace,
                    and watermelons cut in the shape of lotus petals which symbolize reunion. Teacups were placed
                    on stone tables in the garden, where the family would pour tea and chat, waiting for the moment when
                    the full moon's reflection appeared in the center of their cups. Owing to the timing of the plant's
                    blossoms, cassia wine is the traditional choice for the "reunion wine" drunk on the occasion.
                    Also, people will celebrate by eating cassia cakes and candy. In some places, people will celebrate
                    by drinking osmanthus wine and eating osmanthus mooncakes.<br><br>

                    Food offerings made to deities are placed on an altar set up in the courtyard, including apples,
                    pears, peaches, grapes, pomegranates, melons, oranges, and pomelos. One of the first decorations
                    purchased for the celebration table is a clay statue of the Jade Rabbit. In Chinese folklore, the Jade
                    Rabbit was an animal that lived on the Moon and accompanied Chang'e. Offerings of soy beans and cockscomb
                    flowers were made to the Jade Rabbit.<br><br>

                    Nowadays, in southern China, people will also eat some seasonal fruit that may differ in different
                    district but carrying the same meaning of blessing.

                    The Mid-Autumn moon has traditionally been a choice occasion to celebrate marriages.
                    Girls would pray to Moon deity Chang'e to help fulfill their romantic wishes.<br><br>

                    In some parts of China, dances are held for young men and women to find partners.
                    For example, young women are encouraged to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd,
                    and the young man who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance.
                    In Daguang, in southwest Guizhou Province, young men and women of the Dong people would
                    make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear
                    remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front
                    of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs

                    traditional games among men, women and children on or around the Mid-Autumn

                    While being enveloped in the smoke of burning incense, she describes the beautiful
                    sights and sounds she encounters.<br><br>
                    Another activity, "Descent into the Garden" (Chinese: 落花园 luò huāyuán), played among
                    younger girls, detailed each girl's visit to the heavenly gardens. According to legend,
                    a flower tree represented her, and the number and color of the flowers indicated the sex
                    and number of children she would have in her lifetime.<br><br>
                    Men played a game called "Descent of the Eight Immortals" (jiangbaxian), where one of
                    the Eight Immortals took possession of a player, who would then assume the role of a scholar or warrior.<br><br>
                    Children would play a game called "Encircling the Toad" (guanxiamo), where the group would
                    form a circle around a child chosen to be a Toad King and chanted a song that transformed the
                    child into a toad. He would jump around like a toad until water was sprinkled on his head, in which he would then stop.

                <h5 class="description">
                    A notable part of celebrating the holiday is the carrying of brightly lit lanterns,
                    lighting lanterns on towers, or floating sky lanterns. Another tradition involving
                    lanterns is to write riddles on them and have other people try to guess the answers
                    (simplified Chinese: 灯谜; traditional Chinese: 燈謎; pinyin: dēng mí; lit. 'lantern riddles').<br><br>

                    It is difficult to discern the original purpose of lanterns in connection to the festival,
                    but it is certain that lanterns were not used in conjunction with Moon-worship prior to the
                    Tang dynasty. Traditionally, the lantern has been used to symbolize fertility, and functioned
                    mainly as a toy and decoration. But today the lantern has come to symbolize the festival itself.
                    In the old days, lanterns were made in the image of natural things, myths, and local cultures.
                    Over time, a greater variety of lanterns could be found as local cultures became influenced by
                    their neighbors.<br><br>

                    As China gradually evolved from an agrarian society to a mixed agrarian-commercial one,
                    traditions from other festivals began to be transmitted into the Mid-Autumn Festival,
                    such as the putting of lanterns on rivers to guide the spirits of the drowned as practiced
                    during the Ghost Festival, which is observed a month before. Hong Kong fishermen during
                    the Qing dynasty, for example, would put up lanterns on their boats for the Ghost Festival and
                    keep the lanterns up until Mid-Autumn Festival

                <h5 class="description">
                    The festival was a time to enjoy the successful reaping of rice and wheat with food
                    offerings made in honor of the moon. Today, it is still an occasion for outdoor reunions
                    among friends and relatives to eat mooncakes and watch the Moon, a symbol of harmony and unity.
                    During a year of a solar eclipse, it is typical for governmental offices, banks, and schools to
                    close extra days in order to enjoy the extended celestial celebration an eclipse brings. The
                    festival is celebrated with many cultural or regional customs, among them:<br><br>

                    Burning incense in reverence to deities including Chang'e.
                    Performance of dragon and lion dances, which is mainly practiced in southern China.
